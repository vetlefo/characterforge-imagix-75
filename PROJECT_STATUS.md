- Implement adaptive canvas modes based on creative intent
- Build canvas state management system
- Design layout with conversation and canvas sections

### Week 3: Media Generation & Transformation
- Implement media generation from descriptions
- Create transformation system for media types
- Build style extraction functionality
- Implement drawing-to-code conversion

### Week 4: Integration & Polish
- Connect all systems together
- Implement context-aware toolbars

- Performance optimizations and bug fixes

## Priorities for Immediate Implementation

1. **Enhanced Conversation Interface**
   - This is the core interaction point for users
   - Will leverage our existing intent translation and command parsing work
   - Enables the natural language-driven creative experience

2. **Integrated Creative Canvas**
   - Creates the unified workspace where creation happens
   - Adapts to different creative modes based on intent
   - Provides real-time feedback based on conversation

## Technical Debt & Issues to Address

1. Improve test coverage for:
   - Creative Context Provider
   - Conversation components
   - Any new components created

2. Consider moving to a real graph database for production
   - Current in-memory solution is fine for development
   - Will need persistence for production use

3. Optimize performance for larger creative projects
   - Consider lazy loading for asset library
   - Implement virtualization for conversation history

## Considerations for Future Development

1. Machine learning enhancements for intent translation
2. Voice input capabilities
3. Export/import functionality for creative projects
4. Collaborative editing features
5. Extended media transformation capabilities
6. Evaluate SvelteKit for specific application sections

## Technology Exploration

We're currently exploring the following technologies to enhance our application:

1. **Svelte 5 Integration**: Using Svelte 5 components with the new "runes" syntax for efficient UI elements, compiled as web components for seamless React integration (see `SVELTE_INTEGRATION.md`)

2. **Creative Intent Pipeline**: Building a sophisticated intent translation system that converts natural language to actionable creative operations

3. **Graph Database Integration**: Using graph structures to maintain relationships between creative elements and improve context awareness
