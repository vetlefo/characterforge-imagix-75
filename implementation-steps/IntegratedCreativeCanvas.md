# IntegratedCreativeCanvas Implementation Plan

## Overview
The IntegratedCreativeCanvas is a unified workspace that adapts to different creative modes based on user intent. It serves as the visual component of our fluid creative experience, working alongside the ConversationalInterface.

## Core Requirements
- Provide a unified canvas for all creative activities
- Adapt to different modes based on creative intent
- Support multiple rendering modes (drawing, animation, styling, etc.)
- Connect with command execution system
- Provide context-aware toolbars and controls
- Integrate with the conversation interface

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 days)
1. Create IntegratedCreativeCanvas.tsx component
   - Set up basic structure with container and viewport
   - Implement canvas state management
   - Create mode switching mechanism

2. Build Canvas Renderers
   - Create renderer components for different modes
   - Implement DrawingRenderer for sketching and drawing
   - Build StyleRenderer for design system visualization
   - Develop AnimationRenderer for motion design

3. Implement Mode-Specific Controls
   - Create contextual toolbars for each mode
   - Design unified control interface
   - Implement proper state management for tool settings

### Phase 2: Intent-Driven Adaptation (2 days)
1. Connect with Creative Context
   - Subscribe to creative intent changes
   - Implement mode switching based on intent
   - Maintain context when switching modes

2. Create Intent-to-Action Mapping
   - Map structured intents to canvas actions
   - Implement action execution on canvas
   - Handle parameter application to canvas elements

3. Add Visual Feedback
   - Show active elements based on context
   - Highlight elements mentioned in conversation
   - Provide visual cues for intent recognition

### Phase 3: Asset Integration (1-2 days)
1. Connect with Asset Library
   - Load and display assets on canvas
   - Implement asset manipulation controls
   - Support drag and drop from library

2. Create Asset Contextual Tools
   - Build property editors for assets
   - Implement positioning and transformation tools
   - Add style controls for visual assets

3. Implement Asset Relationship Visualization
   - Show connections between related assets
   - Visualize parent-child relationships
   - Indicate style inheritance

### Phase 4: Conversation Integration (1-2 days)
1. Create Bidirectional Communication
   - Update conversation based on canvas actions
   - Reflect conversation intents on canvas
   - Synchronize selection states

2. Implement Command Execution
   - Execute parsed commands on canvas
   - Provide visual feedback for command execution
   - Handle command parameters correctly

3. Add Result Visualization
   - Show command execution results
   - Provide before/after comparisons
   - Animate transitions between states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
src/
  components/
    creative/
      IntegratedCreativeCanvas/
        IntegratedCreativeCanvas.tsx    // Main component
        CanvasViewport.tsx              // The canvas display area
        ContextualToolbar.tsx           // Mode-specific tools
        Renderers/                      // Mode-specific renderers
          DrawingRenderer.tsx           // For drawing mode
          StyleRenderer.tsx             // For style editing
          AnimationRenderer.tsx         // For animation
          WebsiteRenderer.tsx           // For website preview
        Controls/                       // Shared controls
          TransformControls.tsx         // Position, scale, rotate
          StyleControls.tsx             // Color, typography, etc.
          AnimationControls.tsx         // Timeline, keyframes
```

### State Management
- Canvas state in CreativeContext
- Mode-specific state in local React state
- Element selection and manipulation state
- Tool settings and preferences

### Data Flow
1. Intent changes in CreativeContext
2. Canvas adapts mode based on intent
3. Renderer components update to reflect mode
4. Contextual tools update based on mode
5. User interactions update canvas state
6. State changes reflected in conversation

### Performance Considerations
- Use canvas rendering where appropriate (not just DOM)
- Implement layer-based rendering for complex scenes
- Consider web workers for intensive operations
- Optimize render cycle with useMemo and useCallback

### Testing Plan
- Unit tests for core canvas functionality
- Integration tests with command execution
- Visual regression tests for renderers
- Mock interactions for user behavior testing

## Future Enhancements
- 3D rendering capabilities
- AR/VR visualization options
- Real-time collaboration on canvas
- Advanced filter and effect systems
- Export to multiple formats
