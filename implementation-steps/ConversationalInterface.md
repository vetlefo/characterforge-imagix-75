# ConversationalInterface Implementation Plan

## Overview
The ConversationalInterface is the primary user interaction point for our fluid creative experience. It will leverage our existing intent translation and command parsing systems to provide a natural language-driven creative environment.

## Core Requirements
- Provide a chat-like interface for user input
- Process and display conversation history
- Parse user input for creative intent
- Generate appropriate system responses
- Connect with command execution systems
- Support embedded interactive elements in messages
- Visualize different types of messages appropriately

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (1-2 days)
1. Create ConversationalInterface.tsx component
   - Set up basic layout with history and input areas
   - Implement input handling and submission
   - Connect to CreativeContext for history management

2. Enhance ConversationMessage component
   - Support different message types (text, media, code, interactive)
   - Implement proper styling and layout for each type
   - Add handling for embedded actions

3. Create MessageGroup component
   - Group related messages together
   - Provide visual cues for message relationships
   - Handle timestamps and metadata

### Phase 2: Intent Processing (1-2 days)
1. Integrate with Intent Translation
   - Connect user input to intentTranslator service
   - Process natural language into structured intents
   - Handle confidence scores and potential ambiguities

2. Implement Response Generation
   - Create reusable response templates
   - Generate contextual responses based on intent
   - Support different response types (text, actions, media)

3. Add Context Awareness
   - Use conversation history for context
   - Leverage GraphDB for relationship information
   - Maintain coherent conversation flow

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements (1-2 days)
1. Create Interactive Message Components
   - Design components for action confirmation
   - Implement selection UI for disambiguating intents
   - Create preview components for actions

2. Implement Action Execution
   - Connect parsed commands to executable actions
   - Handle action results and feedback
   - Update conversation with action outcomes

3. Add Visual Feedback
   - Show loading states during processing
   - Provide success/error indicators
   - Animate transitions between states

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (1-2 days)
1. Connect with Creative Canvas
   - Ensure seamless interaction with canvas
   - Implement visual feedback between conversation and canvas
   - Handle canvas state updates based on conversation

2. Optimize Performance
   - Implement virtualization for large conversation histories
   - Add lazy loading for embedded media
   - Optimize render cycles

3. Add Accessibility Features
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Support screen readers

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
src/
  components/
    creative/
      ConversationalInterface/
        ConversationalInterface.tsx  // Main component
        ConversationHistory.tsx      // Displays message history
        ConversationInput.tsx        // User input handling
        MessageGroup.tsx             // Groups related messages
        InteractiveElements/         // Interactive message components
          ActionConfirmation.tsx     // For confirming actions
          IntentDisambiguation.tsx   // For clarifying ambiguous intents
          ResultPreview.tsx          // For previewing action results
```

### State Management
- Use CreativeContext for global state
- Local state for input handling and UI state
- React Query or similar for async operations

### Data Flow
1. User enters text in ConversationInput
2. On submission, text is added to conversation history
3. Intent translation processes the input
4. Response generation creates appropriate response
5. Response is added to conversation history
6. Any actions are executed and results reflected in UI

### Testing Plan
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for the full conversation flow
- Mock the intent translation and action execution services
- Test different input types and edge cases

## Future Enhancements
- Voice input capabilities
- Rich text formatting
- Drag and drop media integration
- Collaborative conversation features
- Custom message templates
