## Tasks by Priority

### High Priority (Current Focus)
1. ✅ Integrate Command Parser with Creative Context
2. ✅ Implement conversation history in Creative Context
3. 🏁 Create basic ConversationalInterface component
4. 🏁 Connect parsed commands to executable actions

### Medium Priority
1. ✅ Build relationship tracking between creative elements
2. ✅ Implement context-aware suggestions
3. 🔜 Create adaptive canvas based on intent
4. 🔜 Design integrated workspace layout

### Lower Priority
1. 📅 Advanced media transformations
2. 📅 Refine conversation visualization
3. 📅 Performance optimizations
4. ✅ Additional command types and domains

### Test Coverage
1. ✅ Unit tests for core services
2. ✅ Integration tests for command processing
3. 🏁 Component tests for ConversationalInterface
4. 🔜 End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Graph Database Integration

- [x] Create GraphDB service adapter
- [x] Implement mock in-memory graph database for testing
- [x] Integrate with CreativeContext for relationship management
- [x] Extend asset management with graph capabilities
- [x] Enhance conversation logging with graph relationships
- [x] Make creative intent analysis use graph data
- [x] Create GraphIntegrationDemo page to visualize the graph
- [ ] Connect to a real graph database (DGraph, Neo4j, etc.)

## Intent Translation System

- [x] Design a multi-strategy intent translation architecture
- [x] Implement casual expression mapping to precise intents
- [x] Create context-aware intent derivation
- [x] Build command amplification for brief inputs
- [x] Integrate with graph database for relationship-based inference
- [x] Add confidence scoring for translated intents
- [x] Create IntentTranslatorDemo page with interactive examples
- [ ] Connect to machine learning model for enhanced translation

## Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Vitest configuration
- [x] Create test utilities for React components
- [x] Implement mocks for browser APIs and external services
- [x] Add unit tests for core services
- [x] Create integration tests for command processing pipeline
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for critical paths

## Notes and Decisions

- Command Parser now uses confidence scoring to improve command recognition
- Intent classification uses a combination of keyword matching and parameter context
- Graph database provides context for better recommendations and understanding
- Enhanced Creative Context supports tracking and traversing relationships
- The system should maintain backward compatibility with current usage patterns
