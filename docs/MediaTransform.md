# Media Transform

The Media Transform system allows you to extract valuable information from images and transform them into usable creative assets including styles, code, and animations.

## Features

### Style Extraction

Extract design information from images:

- **Color Palettes**: Identifies dominant colors, background, text, and accent colors
- **Typography**: Determines font families, sizing, and styling
- **Spacing**: Analyzes layout spacing patterns (padding, margin, gap)

```typescript
// Example result from style extraction
{
  colors: {
    dominant: "#4A90E2",
    palette: ["#4A90E2", "#FFFFFF", "#333333", "#F5F5F5", "#E74C3C"],
    background: "#FFFFFF",
    text: "#333333",
    accent: "#E74C3C"
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "Roboto, sans-serif",
    headingSize: "32px",
    bodySize: "16px",
    lineHeight: 1.5
  },
  spacing: {
    padding: "16px",
    margin: "24px",
    gap: "8px"
  }
}
```

### Code Generation

Transforms visual designs into functioning code:

- **HTML Structure**: Creates semantic markup from visual hierarchy
- **CSS Styling**: Applies extracted styles to elements
- **JavaScript Interactions**: Adds basic interactivity when needed

The generated code can be:
- Previewed in real-time
- Edited and refined
- Exported for use in other projects

### Animation Generation

Creates animations based on static images:

- **Motion Detection**: Analyzes image elements to determine natural movement paths
- **Keyframe Creation**: Generates keyframes for smooth animation
- **CSS Animation**: Produces ready-to-use CSS animations
- **Customization**: Allows adjustment of timing, easing, and properties

## Integration Points

The Media Transform system integrates with other platform components:

- **Style System**: Apply extracted styles to your creative projects
- **Asset Library**: Store and manage transformed assets
- **Website Preview**: Test generated code in the preview environment
- **Animation System**: Refine generated animations

## How to Use

### Style Extraction Process

1. Navigate to the Media Transform page
2. Upload or select an image
3. Click "Extract Styles"
4. Review the extracted color palette, typography, and spacing
5. Use the extracted styles in your projects

### Code Generation Process

1. Choose an image to transform
2. Select the code generation option
3. Choose between component types (card, header, gallery, etc.)
4. Generate and preview the code
5. Make adjustments as needed
6. Export or implement in your project

### Animation Generation Process

1. Select an image for animation
2. Choose animation preferences (duration, style, elements to animate)
3. Generate the animation
4. Preview and refine the result
5. Export as CSS or integrate with the Animation System

## Technical Implementation

The Media Transform system uses various algorithms for analysis:

- Color quantization for palette extraction
- Edge detection for layout analysis
- Pattern recognition for typography classification
- Visual hierarchy analysis for structural code generation
- Motion path prediction for animation generation

## Best Practices

- Use high-quality images for better extraction results
- Simple, clean designs yield more accurate transformations
- Consider the intended use case when selecting transformation options
- Review and refine automated results for optimal quality
- Combine extracted styles with manual adjustments for best results
