# Animation System

The Animation System provides tools for creating, previewing, and exporting motion designs.

## Features

- **Keyframe Animation**: Define key points in animation sequences
- **Timeline Interface**: Visual control over animation timing
- **Preview Capabilities**: Real-time animation preview
- **Animation Editor**: Configure animation properties and behavior

## Components

### AnimationSystem

The main container component that houses the animation preview and editor.

```typescript
// Basic usage
<AnimationProvider>
  <AnimationSystem />
</AnimationProvider>
```

### AnimationPreview

Displays the current animation in real-time, allowing users to visualize their creation.

### AnimationEditor

Provides controls for modifying animation properties, timing, and behavior.

## Context Provider

The Animation System uses React Context for state management:

```typescript
// Access animation context in a component
const { animations, currentAnimation, updateAnimation } = useAnimation();
```

## Technical Implementation

The Animation System leverages CSS animations and transitions with React state management to create a cohesive animation creation experience. The system allows for exporting animations as CSS or JavaScript code for use in web projects.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for the Animation System include:

- More animation presets and easing functions
- Advanced path-based animations
- Export options for various frameworks
- Interaction-based animation triggers
